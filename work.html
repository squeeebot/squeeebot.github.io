                  <li> This 12 week summer internship provided me with excellent exposure to a technical career.  The role required me to work as part of a small team on the CICS product.  In addition to the transfer of the product to Rational Team Client, I had responsibility for getting the information from an old release to the new online knowledge centre with the need to meet iteration deadlines for external parties. The role required me to teach myself XML and to interact daily with the extended team within IBM.
